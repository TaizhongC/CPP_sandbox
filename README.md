# CPP Algorithm Implementation Collection

This repository serves as a personal collection of useful C++ code implementations and algorithm explorations. It includes various algorithmic solutions, optimisation techniques, and programming patterns that I've found helpful in my work.

## Current Implementations

- **Simulated Annealing**: Implementation of the simulated annealing optimisation algorithm with a practical application in land use optimisation
  - Includes distance mapping
  - Performance monitoring
  - Customisable parameters

## Purpose

This repository is maintained to:
- Store reference implementations of algorithms
- Document coding patterns and techniques
- Explore optimisation methods
- Serve as a personal code library

## Usage

Each implementation is contained in its own file with detailed comments explaining the approach and usage. Feel free to use, modify, or learn from these implementations.
